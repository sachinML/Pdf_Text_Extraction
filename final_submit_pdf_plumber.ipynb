The complex comprises of two buildings (32,355 SF rentable area)\\nwith three floorplans: a studio (480 SF), a 1BR/1BA (595 SF), and a 2BR/2BA (710 SF). The\\nimprovements were constructed in 1972 with minor renovations completed in 2020 as tenants\\nrollover. However, the cost spent to date was not provided. Based on discussions with a property\\nrepresentative, there are 9 units with bed bugs and there has been $5,000 spent to date on\\nfumigation costs. There have been no showings in 2 months due to the bed bug issue; however,\\nthe problem is expected to be resolved by January 15th which will make the units\\nhabitable/marketable. Due to the near-term marketing date for the subject, there is no rent loss\\nassociated with the down units. However, the subject is not currently stabilized and requires a\\ndeduction for lease up costs in order to bring the property to a stabilized occupancy.\\nThe subject was 81.25% occupied as of the date of the rent roll provided (9 vacant units) and is\\nnot operating at a stabilized occupancy. The property amenities include on-site laundry while unit\\namenities consist of solid surface counters with dishwashers and refrigerators. NKF inspected\\nthe property on January 7, 2021 and found the improvements to be in average condition at that\\ntime.\\nPlease note that the subject property is legally nonconforming in regard to the current parking\\nrequirement. The current parking requirement states that a property similar to the subject must\\nprovide one space per dwelling unit which would equate to 48 parking spaces for the subject. The\\ncurrent parking available onsite is 36 spaces; however, the property was existing prior to the\\nrevised parking requirements and is grandfathered into the current requirements. If the subject\\nwere to be redeveloped in the future, the parking ratio would be required to adhere to the current\\ndevelopment standards.\\nNewmark Knight Frank\\n1400 East Mississippi Avenue, Suite 950\\nDenver, CO 80246\\nwww.ngkf.com'},\n",

Commercial real estate is transforming and adapting with some similarities and\\nsome differences to previous crises. As the Pandemic has progressed, there has been greater\\nclarity about the effects through metric and transactional data as well as market participant\\ninformation and expectations. Although transactional data is hard to come by, month over month\\nsales volumes are turning positive – they are just still significantly depressed as evidenced by\\n2nd Quarter U.S. sales volume decreasing 68% from the same period last year according to Real\\nCapital Analytics. Available data and analyses are contained within this appraisal report and are\\na foundation to the appraisal. Effects and projections related to COVID-19 will be addressed\\nthroughout the report. The following are highlights relevant to the subject and this market.\\nThe subject’s area is still exhibiting increasing demand as the population growth\\ncontinues to trend upward.\\nCommercial trade within the Denver area has begun increasing as the market has\\nentered its recovery stage from the recent effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\\nSmall office properties and owner-occupied properties have been minimally affected\\nthroughout the pandemic as many smaller companies have returned to work, while\\nlarger corporate structures are increasing remote flexibility.\\nSunrise'},\n",

       "  'content': 'Income Capitalization Approach 83\\nIncome Capitalization Approach\\nThe income capitalization approach reflects the subject’s income-producing capabilities. This\\napproach is based on the assumption that value is created by the expectation of benefits to be\\nderived in the future. Specifically estimated is the amount an investor would be willing to pay to\\nreceive an income stream plus reversion value from a property over a period of time. The two\\ncommon valuation techniques associated with the income capitalization approach are direct\\ncapitalization and the discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis.\\nThe direct capitalization method is normally more appropriate for properties with relatively stable\\noperating histories and expectations. The DCF analysis is more appropriate for investment\\nproperties with multiple or long-term leases, particularly leases with cancellation clauses or\\nrenewal options, and especially in volatile markets.\\nIn this analysis, we utilized only direct capitalization because investors and market participants\\ntypically rely more on this method.\\nRent Roll / Tenant Overview\\nA summary rent roll for the property is shown below, based on our review of leases.

Usually the landlord\\ndelivers the main building shell space or some minimum level of interior build-out, and the tenant\\ncompletes the interior finish, which can include wall, ceiling, and floor finishes, mechanical\\nsystems, interior electricity, and plumbing. Typically these are long-term leases with tenants paying\\nall or most property expenses.\\n\\uf0a8 Surplus Land: Land that is not currently needed to support the existing use but cannot be separated\\nfrom the property and sold off for another use. Surplus land does not have an independent highest\\nand best use and may or may not contribute value to the improved parcel. See also excess land.\\n\\uf0a8 Turnover Vacancy: A method of calculating vacancy allowance that is estimated or considered as\\npart of the potential income estimate when using discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis. As units or\\nsuites turn over and are available for re-leasing, the periodic vacancy time frame (vacancy window)\\nto release the space is considered.\\nSunrise'},\n",

The indicator\\nis designed to pick up distinct shifts in the economy through its four underlying components: employment, housing starts, industrial production, and house prices.\\nThese variables are chosen for their timeliness, frequency and availability. Employment is provided monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and house prices are\\nprovided quarterly by the Federal Housing Finance Agency. Housing starts are estimated by applying several adjustment factors to the Census Bureau's monthly\\npermits data and industrial production is created by combining detailed in-house employment estimates with the Federal Reserve's monthly U.S. industrial production\\ndata.\\nWhen constructing the index, employment, housing starts, and industrial production are smoothed using a three-month moving average in order to better grasp the\\nunderlying trends, while house prices are quarterly data that are converted into a monthly frequency and led by six months. Economic data— particularly at the metro\\narea level—can often be volatile even when smoothed, and to control for sporadic movements in the data, the weights assigned to each component in the final index\\nare inversely proportional to their volatility.\\nCommercial Real Estate: Office-using Employment\\nOffice using employment is the sum of employment in the following industries:\\n5112 Software Publishers\\n512 Motion Picture and Sound Recording Industries\\n515 Broadcasting (except Internet)\\n5171 Wired Telecommunications Carriers\\n5172 Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except Satellite)\\n5179 Other Telecommunications\\n518 Internet Service Providers, Web Search Portals, and Data Processing Services\\n5411 Legal Services\\n5412 Accounting, Tax Preparation, Bookkeeping, and Payroll Services\\n5413 Architectural, Engineering, and Related Services\\n5415 Computer Systems Design and Related Services\\n5416 Management, Scientific, and Technical Consulting Services\\n5418 Advertising and Related Services\\n55 Management of Companies and Enterprises\\n5611 Office Administrative Services\\n5613 Employment Services\\n5614 Business Support Services\\n5615 Travel Arrangement and Reservation Services\\n6211 Offices of Physicians\\n6212 Offices of Dentists\\n6213 Offices of Other Health Practitioners\\n8131 Religious Organizations\\n8133 Social Advocacy Organizations\\n8134 Civic and Social Organizations\\n8139 Business, Professional, Labor, Political, and Similar Organizations\\nFI Financial Activities\\nGVF Federal Government\\nSources: BLS, Moody's Analytics\\nWarehouse Employment.\\nWarehouse employment is the sum of employment in the following industries:\\n4821 Rail Transportation\\n4882 Support Activities for Rail Transportation\\n4851 Urban Transit Systems\\n5621 Waste Collection\\n4841 General Freight Trucking\\nMOODY'S ANALYTICS / IUSA_MDEN / Copyright © 2021, Moody's Analytics, Inc.

The ACS creates estimates based on where surveyed individuals worked in a given week and matched that against their place of residence. Moody\\'s Analytics\\naggregated these counties to metro areas and examined flows at this higher-level geography.\\nThe data are split into two sections. The first represents the commuting patterns of residents of an area; the second shows the commuting patterns of workers in an\\narea. While these are correlated, there can be noticeable differences; for example, a large urban metro area likely attracts a material share of workers from elsewhere,\\nwith a smaller share of its residents commuting outside of the area.\\nThe pie charts reflect the share of residents or workers whose commute does not extend beyond a metro area\\'s borders. Not surprisingly, each figure averages higher\\nthan 80%, as metro areas are defined in large part by commuting patterns to begin with. The rank indicates how self-sufficient an area is. The tables below each chart\\nshow where residents work and where workers reside. This provides a glimpse of which places are most closely linked economically to the area.\\nComparative Employment and Income: Comparative employment provides the proportion of nonfarm payroll employment in every supersector, as defined in the\\nNAICS classification of industries. The BLS does not report employment for every supersector for every metro area. Moody’s Analytics estimates the supersector\\nemployment using a combination of state-level data, data from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, and data from County Business Patterns.\\nComparative income is the average annual earnings by supersector calculated as the ratio of sector income from the BEA divided by employment in the sector, also\\nfrom the BEA.\\nCost of Living: The cost of living index measures the relative cost to the average household in the nation to maintain its standard of living in each metropolitan area.\\nThe index is created by summing expenditures on various components of consumption in each metro area relative to average U.S. expenditures on the components.\\nThe components that vary across metro areas include housing, food and apparel, utilities, transportation and auto insurance.\\nCurrent Employment Trends: Employment is organized into three sectors: government, goods producing industries, and private service producing industries. Goods\\nproducing industries include natural resources and mining, construction and manufacturing. Private service producing industries include trade, transportation and\\nutilities, information, financial activities, professional and business services, education and health services, leisure and hospitality and other services.\\nThe year-over-year growth of payroll employment for the most recent month compared with six and 12 months prior enables the users to track how employment trends\\nhave changed over the preceding two years, and whether the pace of job creation has held steady, decelerated or accelerated. In addition to total payroll employment,\\ndata are available for all of the Bureau of Labor Statistics defined \"super sectors\" listed above. In some smaller metro areas, some of the super sector data are\\nestimated by Moody\\'s Analytics because they are not released by the BLS.\\nDiversity: Industrial diversity is defined as the extent to which a metro area\\'s industrial structure approximates the U.S. industrial structure.\\nDiversity is derived using the following formula:\\nDiversity = 1/Σ((EMPij/EMPUSj)*EMPij)\\nWhere EMP = share of employment in four-digit NAICS industry j during the past three years; i = metro area; US = U.S. The Diversity measure is bounded between 0\\nand 1. 1 means the metro area has the same industrial structure as the U.S.; 0 means it has a totally different industrial structure than the U.S.\\nFormula derived from Hachman index, Bureau of Business and Economic Research, Univ. of Utah, December 1994.\\nEconomic Disenfranchisement: Economic disenfranchisement indicators measure the degree to which income inequality plagues certain economies. To capture this,\\nthree measures are used. The Gini coefficient and poverty rates are published by the American Community Survey (ACS), produced by the Census Bureau. The Gini\\ncoefficient measures income concentration, with 0 representing perfect equality and 1 representing an economy in which all the wealth is held by one individual.\\nThe Palma ratio is a newer measure of income inequality that examines the total income held by earners in the top 10% of households and divides that by aggregate\\nincome held by the bottom 40%. This typically requires household-level financial information, but Moody\\'s Analytics uses a broader distribution of income by\\nMOODY\\'S ANALYTICS / IUSA_MDEN / Copyright © 2021, Moody\\'s Analytics, Inc.

       "  'content': \"household from ACS data to approximate both the numerator and denominator. A higher Palma ratio indicates that a larger share of wealth is concentrated in the\\nwealthiest households in an economy. An advantage of this measure is that it is more sensitive to movements at the tails of the distribution, which typically better\\nrepresent income inequality given that the middle 50% is typically more stable across history and geographies (for more information, refer to Jose Gabriel Palma's\\npaper, “Why is inequality so unequal across the world?”).\\nEconomic Health Check: A heat map made up of high-frequency indicators provides insight into the factors that explain a state's recent performance. The indicators\\nconsidered are all produced in monthly frequency. In order to smooth out month-to-month fluctuations, the three-month moving average is calculated and compared\\nwith the three-month moving average in the prior month. If the change is positive, the cell is shaded green; if no change took place, the cell is shaded yellow; and if\\nthe change is negative, the cell is shaded orange. The high-frequency indicators include the change in payroll employment; change in the unemployment rate, where a\\nlower rate connotes improvement; initial unemployment insurance claims; the labor force participation rate, defined as the share of the working-age noninstitutional\\npopulation older than 16 either looking for work or employed; merchandise exports in $ billions; average weekly hours; industrial production; and residential permits.\\nThe state industrial production index is estimated using national-level industrial production and state-level industry employment.\\nEducational Attainment: The Census Bureau provides data on the educational attainment of residents older than 25 years of age of metro areas and their\\ncomponent counties, states, and the U.S. Educational attainment reflects the industrial composition of an area as well as the prospects that an area has in expanding\\nits industries.\\nEmployment Diffusion Index: A diffusion index measures the breadth of private sector job creation in an area. A low diffusion index indicates that an area relies on\\njust a few industries for growth. A high diffusion index indicates more balanced growth. The diffusion index is constructed by summing the share of three-digit NAICS\\nindustries that have added to payrolls in a given month and half of the share of those industries that have neither added to nor subtracted from payrolls, where 50%\\nindicates an equal balance between industries with increasing and decreasing employment. Because of volatility in month-to-month movements, a six-month moving\\naverage is used. Detailed industry employment data, for 274 industries as specified by the BLS, are used to compile the industry diffusion indexes for states and metro\\nareas. The BLS does not publish payroll numbers for all three-digit industries for metro areas every month. Moody's Analytics estimates the data for any missing\\nNAICS industries.\\nThe following calculation is then used to compute the diffusion index, where the denominator is the total number industries in which employment data are available at\\nthe three-digit NAICS level.\\n((positive/denominator)+(.5*(unchanged/denominator)))*100\\nEntrepreneurship: The entrepreneurship index looks at the share of workers who were employed in firms that are less than 1 year old. This is based on annual data\\nproduced by the Census Bureau as part of the Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS). Because of underlying volatility in the data, especially during changes in the\\nbusiness cycle, a five-year rolling average is used. Areas with a large share of workers employed at relatively new firms are classified as having a favorable\\nentrepreneurial environment.\\nIt is worth noting that the data are available using only 2000 Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA) definitions.\\nTherefore, the county footprint associated with an area may not match the definition used for other metrics. Additionally, for CBSAs that were created in 2010 and for\\nwhich there is not a clear corresponding discontinued metro area that can be mapped to, this box is left blank.\\nForecast Risks: Risk exposure represents the extent to which a metro area economy's employment growth forecast will be vulnerable to upside or downside\\nfluctuations in the upcoming five-year period. The ranking reflects the expected employment volatility associated with a specific metro area, with a higher ranking—and\\nhigher quintile—denoting greater risk. It is important to keep in mind that the ranking represents the relative potential for variation from the forecast; this can be to the\\nupside or downside. A metro area in the first quintile, for example, faces a much wider range of potential outcomes than one in the fifth quintile, which is unlikely to\\ndeviate significantly from the forecast.\\nThere are seven determinants of metro area risk exposure: (1) investment income dependence, (2) metro area size, (3) the prior year’s change in population, (4)\\neducation and healthcare share of output, (5) government share of output, (6) finance share of output, and (7) house price volatility, based on the change in the ratio\\nof median house price to per capita income.\\nRisk exposure should be considered in combination with a metro area’s expected growth rate in order to ascertain the level of certainty associated with an\\nemployment growth forecast. Metro areas with high growth rates and low volatility rankings represent those that are the safest in terms of expected growth, while\\nthose with low growth rates and high volatility are most exposed to highly negative results.\\nSee Regional Financial Review, “Measuring Regional Uncertainty: An Update of Risk-Adjusted Return,” March 2013, for more details.\\nHistorical Volatility: Employment volatility is defined as the standard deviation in a metro area's monthly year-over-year percentage nonagricultural employment\\ngrowth relative to the standard deviation in U.S. year-over-year percentage nonagricultural employment growth over the past 10 years. Volatility of 100 means that\\nemployment volatility in a metro area is equal to employment volatility in the nation. Metro areas tend to be inherently more volatile than states.\\nVolatility due to U.S. fluctuations (also known as “systematic volatility”) is defined as:\\nSYSVOL = (Ri2)1/2\\nwhere SYSVOL = systematic volatility; R2 = is the proportion of total variance in metro area i's growth rate that is associated with contemporaneous fluctuations in\\nnational growth.\\nMOODY'S ANALYTICS / IUSA_MDEN / Copyright © 2021, Moody's Analytics, Inc.

When the observed value of house price\\nindex is greater than the equilibrium value, the average house price is overvalued; when the observed value is less than the equilibrium value, the average house\\nprice is undervalued. The primary factors that determine equilibrium include per capita disposable income, a measure of long-run demand, and construction costs, a\\ngauge of long-run supply. These measures are updated monthly.\\nHouse Prices: FHFA Conventional and Conforming Home Price Index. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) estimates and publishes quarterly house price\\nindexes for single-family detached properties using data on conventional conforming mortgage transactions obtained from the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.\\n(Freddie Mac) and the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae). These indexes use a repeat- purchase method, which is not affected by the mix of homes\\nsold. For example, using traditional house price measures, a rise in the number of low-priced homes sold relative to higher-priced homes will bias house prices\\ndownward even though relative prices may not have changed. Because repeat-purchase house price indexes keep track of successive selling prices for the same\\nproperty, they avoid this bias. Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae are private corporations with federal charters whose mandate is to provide liquidity to the nation's\\nresidential mortgage market. The FHFA was created by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008. The FHFA is the regulator of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and\\nthe Federal Home Loan Banks. This law combined the staffs of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), the Federal Housing Finance Board\\n(FHFB), and the GSE mission office at the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).\\nThe House Price Index is based on transactions involving conforming, conventional mortgages purchased or securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Only\\nmortgage transactions on single-family properties are included. A conforming mortgage is one that both meets the underwriting guidelines of Fannie Mae or Freddie\\nMac and that does not exceed the conforming loan limit. The conforming limit for single-family homes is $417,000 as of January 2014, with higher limits for high-cost\\nmetro areas. Conventional means that the mortgages are neither insured nor guaranteed by the FHA, VA, or other federal government entity. Because of the\\nconforming limit, the FHFA repeat-purchase index is less reliable in those states, such as California, Connecticut and New Jersey, where many homes are typically\\npriced above the purchase limits.\\nIndustrial Production: Industrial production is calculated using the Federal Reserve Board's detailed industrial production data and the Moody's Analytics detailed\\nemployment estimates. The Federal Reserve publishes industrial production at the 3-digit (and some 4-digit) level NAICS industry detail. Weights are calculated for\\neach of the available industries for each metro area, where the weight equals a given industry's share of manufacturing employment. Weights are then applied to the\\ndetailed industrial production series and aggregated to create a metro-specific estimated industrial production series. The same process is also applied to the U.S.\\nsince IP series report by the Fed includes mining and electric and gas utilities whereas our estimated series do not.\\nIndustry Concentrations: High-Tech Employment\\nMoody's Analytics defines high-tech employment as the sum of employment in the following industries:\\nNAICS Industry\\n3254 Pharm. & Medicine Manuf.\\n3341 Computer and Peripheral Equip.

       "  'content': '4233 Lumber and Other Construction Materials Merchant Wholesalers\\n5313 Activities Related to Real Estate\\nIndustry Performance: Moody\\'s Analytics payroll employment forecasts are based on establishment employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics\\' (BLS) 790\\nsurvey. Metro area models incorporate separate equations for the thirteen NAICS employment super sectors as defined by the BLS, with additional forecast detail in\\nthe manufacturing and government sectors. These separate forecasts are aggregated to arrive at the total employment forecast. The employment equations are\\nspecified differently depending on whether the sectors are export or locally-oriented activities.\\nExport-Oriented Industries. The export-oriented industries include those businesses that primarily sell goods and/or services outside the state. Those businesses\\nconsidered to be export based are more closely linked to national or state level variables such as aggregate demand. All natural resource and manufacturing\\nindustries are considered export industries in our models. The income generated from these businesses provides an important source of demand for the state\\'s\\nlocally-oriented sectors.\\nWe forecast employment in six broad manufacturing categories using the relative importance of the industry in the national economy, and sum these up to obtain\\nmanufacturing employment. Natural resource employment is also closely linked to state and national industrial employment forecasts, and is broadly independent of\\nlocal area economic conditions.\\nLocally-Oriented Industries. Most service and trade industries are considered locally-oriented industries. Locally-oriented industries include construction, wholesale and\\nretail trade, business and financial activities, education and health services, leisure and hospitality industries, state and local government, and utilities. These are often\\ntimes support services, providing the necessary infrastructure for the export-oriented sectors and the local population. These equations are modeled as a function of a\\ndemand proxy (typically personal income), and sometimes demographics and state-wide industry trends.\\nPersonal income is the most commonly used proxy, either alone or in combination with population, for the level of demand for local goods and services. Personal\\nincome is one of the best measures of aggregate economic activity at the state level, reflecting wages and salaries, transfer payments, as well as non-wage income.\\nSince employment in the local economy is an important determinant of wages and salaries in a region, this introduces an important source of feedback into the\\nmodels. In other words, personal income is a function of employment, and certain employment categories such as personal services are a function of income. Where\\ndeemed necessary, variables besides personal income and population are also used in forecasting service industries. For instance, employment in the construction\\nindustry is linked to recent permit issuance, while retail trade employment is linked to recent retail sales.\\nSource: Moody\\'s Analytics\\nLeading Industries by Wage Tier: To determine the high-, middle- and low-wage industries for a given geography, the average U.S. wage is calculated first by\\ndividing total salary disbursements by total employment. Average wages by industry are calculated using U.S. level wage and employment data for all four-digit NAICS\\ncodes. Next, the standard deviation of the average wages across industries is calculated. One standard deviation centered at the mean defines the upper and lower\\nbounds separating the high, middle and low tiers. The average wage in the given geography for each four-digit NAICS industry is calculated next. The industry is\\ncategorized as high, middle or low wage by comparing it with the national high and low cutoffs. The industries are then ranked by size.\\nFor each industry, the location quotient is calculated. Location quotients are used to indicate whether the industry serves a market larger than that of the metro area or\\nis an \"export\" industry. A location quotient greater than 1 likely indicates an export industry. Location quotients are calculated according to the formula:\\nLCim = (Eim/Etm)/(Eius/Etus)\\nwhere LC = location quotient in metro area m for industry i;\\nE = employment in industry i for metro area m or the U.S.;\\nand t = total employment for metro area m or the U.S.\\nMigration Flows: IRS data. When a taxpayer notifies the IRS of a change in address, the IRS records the household\\'s current county of residence, the county to\\nwhich the household is moving, and the number of household members. Moody\\'s Analytics aggregates these data by metro area into gross migration. The data are\\nthen sorted to show the 10 metro areas providing the largest number of new residents and the 10 metro areas to where the largest number of current residents\\nmoves. Subtracting the gross out-migration flows from the gross in-migration flows gives net out-migration. The IRS migration data cover only households that file\\nreturns and thus do not provide a complete tally of domestic migration flows.\\nNet Migration: Census data. The Census measure of net migration attempts to capture all migration to and from counties. Unlike the IRS data, Census data cover all\\nmigrants, including international migrants. Moody\\'s Analytics aggregates county net migration data to metro areas and to states. Domestic and international net\\nmigration were re-estimated for years 2001-2010, because the Census has no plans to do this. Pre-existing net migration estimates (derived from new census\\npopulation estimates combined with constant birth and death rates) were used. The “weights” for domestic and international migration are the same as those that\\nexisted before.\\nPer Capita Income: Per capita income is defined as personal income divided by population. It is not adjusted for inflation.\\nPopulation by Age: The Census Bureau provides data on population by age for metro areas and their component counties, states, and the U.S. A distribution that\\ndiffers significantly from the national distribution has implications for the labor, housing and consumer markets in an area. For example, a distribution skewed toward\\nolder cohorts implies higher than average demand for healthcare services and lower than average demand for single-family housing.\\nPopulation by Generation: The distribution of an area\\'s population into generations employs definitions from the Pew Research Center. Generations are defined by\\nthe following birth years:\\nThe Greatest Generation — 1901 to 1927\\nMOODY\\'S ANALYTICS / IUSA_MDEN / Copyright © 2021, Moody\\'s Analytics, Inc.

       "  'content': 'The Silent Generation — 1928 to 1945\\nThe Baby Boom Generation — 1946 to 1964\\nGeneration X — 1965 to 1980\\nThe Millennial Generation — 1981 to 1998\\nGeneration Z — 1999 to present\\nProductivity: Productivity is measured as real output per worker in a state. High productivity incorporates the efficient use of labor, machines, and technological\\nimprovements. Generally, more productive areas will also have higher wages. However, higher wages do not necessarily reduce an area\\'s competitiveness because\\nthe higher productivity may more than offset the higher wages. High productivity may also reflect the industry composition in a state, as a concentration of more\\nproductive industries will boost overall productivity.\\nRelative Employment Outlook*: In order to compare the performance of a metro area\\'s labor market with that of the U.S. and state, an index is calculated in which\\nthe value of the Bureau of Labor Statistics payroll employment in the first quarter of 10 years prior to the current year is set at 100. Forecast data for the next five\\nyears are also provided. The shaded gray bar represents the period of the 2008-2009 national recession.\\nIn addition, we track how the two- and five-year employment forecasts for the metro area, state and U.S. have changed compared with six months prior. A dash\\nindicates no change, an upward arrow indicates a more optimistic outlook and a downward arrow indicates a more pessimistic outlook. For the two year forecast, a\\ndifference in average annual growth larger than 0.1 percentage point indicates a change. For the five-year forecast, a difference larger than 0.25 percentage point\\nindicates a change.\\nRental and Housing Vacancy: The homeowner vacancy rate is the proportion of the homeowner housing inventory that is vacant for sale. It is computed by dividing\\nthe number of vacant units for sale by the sum of owner-occupied units, vacant units that are sold but awaiting occupancy, and vacant units for sale and then\\nmultiplying by 100.\\nThe rental vacancy rate is the proportion of the rental inventory that is vacant for rent. It is computed by dividing the number of vacant units for rent by the sum of\\nrenter-occupied units, vacant units that are rented but awaiting occupancy, and vacant units for rent and then multiplying by 100.\\nSkills Mismatch: Skills mismatch is determined based on two components: the distribution of educational attainment of a population and the educational characters\\nassociated with jobs in an area. The two are compared along six dimensions, with each showing how closely aligned the educational attainment of the general\\npopulation is with the requirements of an area\\'s jobs. Although educational attainment is not a perfect proxy for skills, it can be quantified in a way that specific skills,\\nsuch as trade, cannot, making it a useful window into whether an economy faces struggles to find qualified workers or if skilled workers may struggle to find\\nopportunities locally and be forced to migrate elsewhere. Educational attainment for residents is obtained directly from the American Community Survey. The skill\\nrequirements side is based on local occupational employment data from the BLS. This was used to construct a matrix of occupations by educational attainment in\\neach place being examined; this is calculated by applying the national educational share for each occupation to the total number employed in each occupation in a\\nspecific economy. The total for each educational level across all occupations was then summed to determine educational requirements for an area.\\nSnapshot: Business Cycle Status\\nThe business cycle status identifies the stage of the business cycle that characterizes an area\\'s recent performance. There are five categories: in recession, early\\nexpansion, mid-expansion, late expansion, and at risk. The evaluation of an area\\'s status is based on a six-month test of either contraction or expansion. The\\nsix-month test compares the six-month moving average of the business cycle index in the current period with the six-month moving average in the period six months\\nearlier. An area is \"in recession\" if the six-month test shows contraction. If a trough has been reached, the economy shifts from recession to \"early expansion.\" Once\\nthe business cycle indicator reaches a peak, the area is in \"mid-expansion\" or \"late expansion.\" If it appears that a local peak may have been reached and the\\nbusiness cycle indicator is increasing but at a decreasing rate, then the economy is placed \"at risk.\" At risk indicates that the economy could slip from expansion or\\nrecovery to recession if the index has fallen but for less than six months. The distinction between mid-expansion and late expansion is based on the short-term trend\\nobserved in the economy. This is calculated using a K-means clustering approach, in which changes in job growth, the unemployment rate, and the housing market\\nare normalized using standard deviations and benchmarked against national trends at various points in the business cycle. For those areas that have been classified\\nas being in mid- or late-cycle expansion, this index is used to differentiate between the two.\\nEmployment Growth\\nThese numbers represent two-year and five-year average annual payroll employment growth. The forecasts are generated using Moody\\'s Analytics metro modeling\\nsystem. Moody\\'s Analytics employment forecasts are based on establishment employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics\\' (BLS) 790 survey. Metro area\\nmodels incorporate separate equations for the thirteen NAICS employment super sectors as defined by the BLS, with additional forecast detail in the manufacturing\\nand government sectors. These separate forecasts are aggregated to arrive at the total employment forecast. The employment equations are specified differently\\ndepending on whether the sectors are export or locally-oriented activities.\\nExport-Oriented Industries. The export-oriented industries include those businesses that primarily sell goods and/or services outside the state. Those businesses\\nconsidered to be export based are more closely linked to national or state level variables such as aggregate demand. All natural resource and manufacturing\\nindustries are considered export industries in our models. The income generated from these businesses provides an important source of demand for the state\\'s\\nlocally-oriented sectors.\\nWe forecast employment in six broad manufacturing categories using the relative importance of the industry in the national economy, and sum these up to obtain\\nmanufacturing employment. Natural resource employment is also closely linked to state and national industrial employment forecasts, and is broadly independent of\\nlocal area economic conditions.\\nLocally-Oriented Industries. Most service and trade industries are considered locally-oriented industries. Locally-oriented industries include construction, wholesale and\\nretail trade, business and financial activities, education and health services, leisure and hospitality industries, state and local government, and utilities. These are often\\ntimes support services, providing the necessary infrastructure for the export-oriented sectors and the local population. These equations are modeled as a function of a\\ndemand proxy (typically personal income), and sometimes demographics and state-wide industry trends.\\nMOODY\\'S ANALYTICS / IUSA_MDEN / Copyright © 2021, Moody\\'s Analytics, Inc.

       "  'content': 'Personal income is the most commonly used proxy, either alone or in combination with population, for the level of demand for local goods and services. Personal\\nincome is one of the best measures of aggregate economic activity at the state level, reflecting wages and salaries, transfer payments, as well as non-wage income.\\nSince employment in the local economy is an important determinant of wages and salaries in a region, this introduces an important source of feedback into the\\nmodels. In other words, personal income is a function of employment, and certain employment categories such as personal services are a function of income. Where\\ndeemed necessary, variables besides personal income and population are also used in forecasting service industries. For instance, employment in the construction\\nindustry is linked to recent permit issuance, while retail trade employment is linked to recent retail sales.\\nSource: Moody\\'s Analytics\\nLife-Cycle Phase\\nA metro area\\'s life cycle is calculated using a weighted index based on the factors that determine long-term economic performance. High-tech share of GDP (5%\\nweight) is measured as the share of GDP contributed by high-technology industries. Educational attainment (21% weight) is the share of the population 25 and older\\nthat has earned a bachelor\\'s degree or higher. Climate (3% weight) measures the absolute average temperature deviation from 65 degrees. Geographic factors (6%\\nweight) measures location-specific factors such as mountains and coasts that are conducive to development. Export share of employment (8% weight) is the\\npercentage of employment in export-oriented industries relative to the national average. Relative business costs (30% weight) are measured by the Moody\\'s Analytics\\nCost of Doing Business Index. Migration contribution (15% weight) measures the annual ratio of net migration to population. Construction activity (12% weight) is the\\n10-year average share of employment in construction industries relative to total employment.\\nSource: Moody\\'s Analytics\\nMoody\\'s Ratings\\nThis is the bond rating for general obligation bonds issued by a principal city or county government. Not all city and county governments issue GO bonds and thus\\nsome metro areas will have an \"NA\" here. The interpretation of the bond rating is as follows:\\nAaa Best quality, smallest degree of investment risk\\nAa High quality, margins of protection not as large as in Aaa\\nA Upper medium grade obligations, adequately secured\\nBaa Medium grade obligations, neither highly protected nor poorly secured\\nBa Speculative, future cannot be considered as well assured\\nB Lacking characteristics of desired investment\\nThe modifier 1 indicates that the issue ranks in the higher end of its generic category; the modifier 2 indicates a midrange ranking; and the modifi er 3 indicates that\\nthe issue ranks in the lower end of its generic category.\\nSource: Moody\\'s Investor Services\\nRisk Exposure\\nRisk exposure represents the extent to which a metro area economy\\'s employment growth forecast will be vulnerable to upside or downside fluctuations in the\\nupcoming five-year period. The ranking reflects the expected employment volatility associated with a specific metro area, with a higher ranking—and higher quintile\\n—denoting greater risk. It is important to keep in mind that the ranking represents the relative potential for variation from the forecast; this can be to the upside or\\ndownside. A metro area in the first quintile, for example, faces a much wider range of potential outcomes than one in the fifth quintile, which is unlikely to deviate\\nsignificantly from the forecast.\\nThere are seven determinants of metro area risk exposure:\\n(1) investment income dependence\\n(2) metro area size\\n(3) the prior year\\'s change in population\\n(4) education and healthcare share of output\\n(5) government share of output\\n(6) finance share of output\\n(7) house price volatility, based on the change in the ratio of median house price to per capita income.\\nRisk exposure should be considered in combination with a metro area\\'s expected growth rate in order to ascertain the level of certainty associated with an\\nemployment growth forecast. Metro areas with high growth rates and low volatility rankings represent those that are the safest in terms of expected growth, while\\nthose with low growth rates and high volatility are most exposed to highly negative results.\\nSee Regional Financial Review, \"Measuring Regional Uncertainty: An Update of Risk-Adjusted Return,\" March 2013, for more details.\\nSource: Moody\\'s Analytics\\nTop Employers: Moody\\'s Analytics compiles top employers lists for every region for the most recent year available. Public sector employment, which is generally\\nproportional to a metro area\\'s population, is provided separately. However, the lists do include public establishments that are not found in every metro area such as\\nmilitary bases or specific federal agencies.\\nVitality: The Moody\\'s Analytics vitality index can be used to assess a metropolitan area\\'s long-term economic potential. The index abstracts from business cycle\\nfluctuations and near-term economic events. Only persistent forces of economic strength or weakness are considered. To maintain a long-term focus, the vitality index\\nwas created with the purpose of predicting the average annual growth rate in an area\\'s gross domestic product over the next 10 years. The following four factors make\\nup the vitality index: (1) industrial structure, (2) excess labor supply, (3) labor force quality, and (4) labor force growth. An index was generated for each of these\\ncomponents. A value of 100 indicates that the component in the metro area\\'s economy matches the component\\'s value nationally; values above 100 indicate that the\\ncomponent in the metro area\\'s economy is above average, and those below 100 indicate the component is below average. The index for industrial structure is called\\nthe industrial vitality index. The three labor inputs are reconciled into a single labor force vitality index in which values of 100 also correspond to the national average.\\nThe labor force vitality index is then combined with the industrial vitality index to produce the metro area\\'s vitality index. Industrial vitality was assigned a 55% weight,\\nand labor force vitality is assigned a 45% weight. These were assigned to achieve maximum correlation between predicted GDP growth and actual GDP growth as\\ndetermined by regression analysis. A vitality index value of 100 is consistent with the nation. Values above 100 suggest there is potential for faster growth, and those\\nbelow 100 suggest the possibility for slower growth. The rank of the 384 U.S.metropolitan areas and metro divisions is also provided.\\nSee Regional Financial Review, \"U.S. Regional Diversity, Volatility and Vitality,\" August 2009 for a detailed explanation.\\nMOODY\\'S ANALYTICS / IUSA_MDEN / Copyright © 2021, Moody\\'s Analytics, Inc.

Therefore, NKF\\nhas not discounted any rent loss for the remainder of the three-year HAP agreement.\\nCost Approach\\nThe cost approach is based on the proposition that the informed purchaser would pay no more\\nfor the subject than the cost to produce a substitute property with equivalent utility. This\\napproach is particularly applicable when the property being appraised involves relatively new\\nimprovements that represent the highest and best use of the land, or when it is improved with\\nrelatively unique or specialized improvements for which there exist few sales or leases of\\ncomparable properties.\\nSales Comparison Approach\\nThe sales comparison approach utilizes sales of comparable properties, adjusted for differences,\\nto indicate a value for the subject. Valuation is typically accomplished using physical units of\\ncomparison such as price per square foot, price per unit, price per floor, etc., or economic units\\nof comparison such as gross rent multiplier. Adjustments are applied to the property units of\\ncomparison derived from the comparable sale. The unit of comparison chosen for the subject is\\nthen used to yield a total value.\\nOlive Tree'}\n",

These subsidized rates are subject to change pending the decision\\nof the Housing Authority (please refer to extraordinary assumptions). The HAP vouchers are\\nscheduled to expire within the next three years and will roll all units to market rates. Based on our\\nconclusion of the subject’s market value in conjunction with asking rates for market-based units,\\nthe current contract rates are in line with market rates, likely due to the frequent HAP changes\\ndesignated (9 contract updates within the last 2 years). Typically, a HAP contract will be signed\\nnear a 20 year term with flat rates for each bedroom count over the entire period, often resulting\\nin a below market rate. However, based on the frequent HAP voucher updates, it is reasonable to\\nconclude that the current contract rates are in line with the subject’s market rates.

The housing market is benefited by record low mortgage rates. Prices\\nare rising rapidly once more and single-family permits have rebounded to prerecession levels.\\nStress points. Major segments of DEN’s economy will take years to fully regain the jobs lost to the COVID-19\\nrecession. Leisure/hospitality has suffered especially severe layoffs, and with colder weather largely shutting down\\noutdoor dining, further progress will be on hold until spring. Airlines, caterers, hotels and restaurants have laid off or\\nfurloughed workers as they grapple with the reduced tourist demand and increased uncertainty. The slump in the\\nenergy industry will remain another drag on DEN’s economy. The metro area is home to headquarters and back-office\\noperations for energy firms that operate elsewhere in the Denver-Julesburg Basin, and with oil prices still far below\\ntheir prerecession levels, energy companies will be slow to hire back workers.\\nHousing. DEN’s rental market will come under increased stress even as single-family housing remains on a tear. The\\nshallow dip and swift rebound in high-wage jobs in DEN preserved prospective homebuyers’ purchasing power, and\\nfueled by ultra-low mortgage rates and a long-running supply imbalance, annual house price appreciation jumped to\\nits highest level since late 2018. Meanwhile the recession’s disproportionate hit to low-wage employment has left\\nrenters struggling to make payments. Reis data indicate that DEN asking rents declined for the first time since the\\nGreat Recession in the third quarter. Moratoriums have kept evictions low throughout the pandemic, but delayed rent\\npayments will come due in January, straining balance sheets of low-wage workers still grappling with lost jobs.\\nRecovery. High case counts and efforts to control virus spread will make for a long winter, but DEN’s recovery will\\npick up late in the year and in 2022. While DEN’s knowledge-based economy has weathered the pandemic relatively\\nwell and resulted in a below-average loss to total payrolls, industries reliant on direct consumer interaction have little\\nscope for further normalization before a vaccine is widely distributed.

Metro area models incorporate separate equations for the thirteen NAICS employment super sectors as defined by the BLS, with additional forecast detail in\\nthe manufacturing and government sectors. These separate forecasts are aggregated to arrive at the total employment forecast. The employment equations are\\nspecified differently depending on whether the sectors are export or locally-oriented activities.\\nExport-Oriented Industries. The export-oriented industries include those businesses that primarily sell goods and/or services outside the state. Those businesses\\nconsidered to be export based are more closely linked to national or state level variables such as aggregate demand. All natural resource and manufacturing\\nindustries are considered export industries in our models. The income generated from these businesses provides an important source of demand for the state\\'s\\nlocally-oriented sectors.\\nWe forecast employment in six broad manufacturing categories using the relative importance of the industry in the national economy, and sum these up to obtain\\nmanufacturing employment. Natural resource employment is also closely linked to state and national industrial employment forecasts, and is broadly independent of\\nlocal area economic conditions.\\nLocally-Oriented Industries. Most service and trade industries are considered locally-oriented industries. Locally-oriented industries include construction, wholesale and\\nretail trade, business and financial activities, education and health services, leisure and hospitality industries, state and local government, and utilities. These are often\\ntimes support services, providing the necessary infrastructure for the export-oriented sectors and the local population. These equations are modeled as a function of a\\ndemand proxy (typically personal income), and sometimes demographics and state-wide industry trends.\\nPersonal income is the most commonly used proxy, either alone or in combination with population, for the level of demand for local goods and services. Personal\\nincome is one of the best measures of aggregate economic activity at the state level, reflecting wages and salaries, transfer payments, as well as non-wage income.\\nSince employment in the local economy is an important determinant of wages and salaries in a region, this introduces an important source of feedback into the\\nmodels. In other words, personal income is a function of employment, and certain employment categories such as personal services are a function of income. Where\\ndeemed necessary, variables besides personal income and population are also used in forecasting service industries. For instance, employment in the construction\\nindustry is linked to recent permit issuance, while retail trade employment is linked to recent retail sales.\\nSource: Moody\\'s Analytics\\nLeading Industries by Wage Tier: To determine the high-, middle- and low-wage industries for a given geography, the average U.S. wage is calculated first by\\ndividing total salary disbursements by total employment. Average wages by industry are calculated using U.S. level wage and employment data for all four-digit NAICS\\ncodes. Next, the standard deviation of the average wages across industries is calculated. One standard deviation centered at the mean defines the upper and lower\\nbounds separating the high, middle and low tiers. The average wage in the given geography for each four-digit NAICS industry is calculated next. The industry is\\ncategorized as high, middle or low wage by comparing it with the national high and low cutoffs. The industries are then ranked by size.\\nFor each industry, the location quotient is calculated. Location quotients are used to indicate whether the industry serves a market larger than that of the metro area or\\nis an \"export\" industry. A location quotient greater than 1 likely indicates an export industry. Location quotients are calculated according to the formula:\\nLCim = (Eim/Etm)/(Eius/Etus)\\nwhere LC = location quotient in metro area m for industry i;\\nE = employment in industry i for metro area m or the U.S.;\\nand t = total employment for metro area m or the U.S.\\nMigration Flows: IRS data. When a taxpayer notifies the IRS of a change in address, the IRS records the household\\'s current county of residence, the county to\\nwhich the household is moving, and the number of household members. Moody\\'s Analytics aggregates these data by metro area into gross migration. The data are\\nthen sorted to show the 10 metro areas providing the largest number of new residents and the 10 metro areas to where the largest number of current residents\\nmoves. Subtracting the gross out-migration flows from the gross in-migration flows gives net out-migration. The IRS migration data cover only households that file\\nreturns and thus do not provide a complete tally of domestic migration flows.\\nNet Migration: Census data. The Census measure of net migration attempts to capture all migration to and from counties. Unlike the IRS data, Census data cover all\\nmigrants, including international migrants. Moody\\'s Analytics aggregates county net migration data to metro areas and to states. Domestic and international net\\nmigration were re-estimated for years 2001-2010, because the Census has no plans to do this. Pre-existing net migration estimates (derived from new census\\npopulation estimates combined with constant birth and death rates) were used. The “weights” for domestic and international migration are the same as those that\\nexisted before.\\nPer Capita Income: Per capita income is defined as personal income divided by population. It is not adjusted for inflation.\\nPopulation by Age: The Census Bureau provides data on population by age for metro areas and their component counties, states, and the U.S. A distribution that\\ndiffers significantly from the national distribution has implications for the labor, housing and consumer markets in an area. For example, a distribution skewed toward\\nolder cohorts implies higher than average demand for healthcare services and lower than average demand for single-family housing.\\nPopulation by Generation: The distribution of an area\\'s population into generations employs definitions from the Pew Research Center. Generations are defined by\\nthe following birth years:\\nThe Greatest Generation — 1901 to 1927\\nMOODY\\'S ANALYTICS / IUSA_MDEN / Copyright © 2021, Moody\\'s Analytics, Inc.

It is important to keep in mind that the ranking represents the relative potential for variation from the forecast; this can be to the upside or\\ndownside. A metro area in the first quintile, for example, faces a much wider range of potential outcomes than one in the fifth quintile, which is unlikely to deviate\\nsignificantly from the forecast.\\nThere are seven determinants of metro area risk exposure:\\n(1) investment income dependence\\n(2) metro area size\\n(3) the prior year\\'s change in population\\n(4) education and healthcare share of output\\n(5) government share of output\\n(6) finance share of output\\n(7) house price volatility, based on the change in the ratio of median house price to per capita income.\\nRisk exposure should be considered in combination with a metro area\\'s expected growth rate in order to ascertain the level of certainty associated with an\\nemployment growth forecast. Metro areas with high growth rates and low volatility rankings represent those that are the safest in terms of expected growth, while\\nthose with low growth rates and high volatility are most exposed to highly negative results.\\nSee Regional Financial Review, \"Measuring Regional Uncertainty: An Update of Risk-Adjusted Return,\" March 2013, for more details.\\nSource: Moody\\'s Analytics\\nTop Employers: Moody\\'s Analytics compiles top employers lists for every region for the most recent year available. Public sector employment, which is generally\\nproportional to a metro area\\'s population, is provided separately. However, the lists do include public establishments that are not found in every metro area such as\\nmilitary bases or specific federal agencies.\\nVitality: The Moody\\'s Analytics vitality index can be used to assess a metropolitan area\\'s long-term economic potential. The index abstracts from business cycle\\nfluctuations and near-term economic events. Only persistent forces of economic strength or weakness are considered. To maintain a long-term focus, the vitality index\\nwas created with the purpose of predicting the average annual growth rate in an area\\'s gross domestic product over the next 10 years. The following four factors make\\nup the vitality index: (1) industrial structure, (2) excess labor supply, (3) labor force quality, and (4) labor force growth. An index was generated for each of these\\ncomponents. A value of 100 indicates that the component in the metro area\\'s economy matches the component\\'s value nationally; values above 100 indicate that the\\ncomponent in the metro area\\'s economy is above average, and those below 100 indicate the component is below average. The index for industrial structure is called\\nthe industrial vitality index. The three labor inputs are reconciled into a single labor force vitality index in which values of 100 also correspond to the national average.\\nThe labor force vitality index is then combined with the industrial vitality index to produce the metro area\\'s vitality index. Industrial vitality was assigned a 55% weight,\\nand labor force vitality is assigned a 45% weight. These were assigned to achieve maximum correlation between predicted GDP growth and actual GDP growth as\\ndetermined by regression analysis. A vitality index value of 100 is consistent with the nation. Values above 100 suggest there is potential for faster growth, and those\\nbelow 100 suggest the possibility for slower growth. The rank of the 384 U.S.metropolitan areas and metro divisions is also provided.\\nSee Regional Financial Review, \"U.S. Regional Diversity, Volatility and Vitality,\" August 2009 for a detailed explanation.\\nMOODY\\'S ANALYTICS / IUSA_MDEN / Copyright © 2021, Moody\\'s Analytics, Inc.
